* Consumers’ year-ahead expectations about their households’ financial situations deteriorated in March, with the share of households expecting a worse financial situation one year from now rising to 30 percent, the highest level since October 2023.
* Mean unemployment expectations—or the mean probability that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher one year from now—jumped by 4.6 ppts to 44.0 percent in March, the highest reading since April 2020.
* The mean perceived probability of losing one’s job in the next twelve months increased by 1.6 ppts to 15.7 percent, the highest level since March 2024. The increase was largest for respondents with annual household incomes below $50,000.",10,2025-04-14 15:01

1i80u3h,m8pgneg,"MicroStrategy’s volatility lends itself well to the hedging strategy, known as convertible arbitrage. In such trades, investors buy the bonds and sell the shares short, betting that the underlying stock remains volatile. The more the stock sways, the more profitable the strategy becomes. That’s because a convertible bond is a hybrid security composed of a bond and a call option that confers the right to convert the bond into stock at a specific price.

“The owner of a convertible bond is long the option, so they are always selling when the stock goes higher and buying when the stock goes lower to stay hedged,” said James Buckham, co-chief investment officer at Wellesley Asset Management, of the arbitrage strategy.

Remember that one /ES contract is worth \~500 shares of SPX.  It's worth \~$300k with the price at \~6000.  Current /ES contracts cost about $21000.  You're leveraged about 15:1 by purchasing a contract.

Each dollar is worth $50 bucks as well.  /ES goes up 100 points, you gain $5000 and vice versa.

r/WallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that.

Politics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.

Still, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.

Here's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot""

Now compare it to this:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.""

The latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.

Put succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.

If you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.

---

All that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. 

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",7,2025-01-20 12:33

1hy1wtg,m6gs6e0,"Earnings season kicks off next week and options positioning is likely to be a headwind for equity returns as put-call skew has declined over the past quarter, suggesting traders are increasingly positioned for near-term upside asymmetry. This is a good inverse indicator as analysis shows that when investors are buying single stock calls (i.e. put-call skew is low), sentiment is too bullish and likely to be a headwind for equities. On the flip side, equity demand in the futures/swaps market has declined significantly over the past few weeks. The futures/swaps markets are typically dominated by macro hedge funds, CTAs, Asset Managers and pension funds and has been an important bullish indicator as their massive flows drive a lot of the market. These systematics are starting to sell now after the recent decline began around the time of the December FOMC meeting and they're just getting started. So dumb retail has been buying calls but the big guys have been deleveraging with greater interest rate uncertainty, but you tards should totally double down on calls ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)",8,2025-01-10 20:48

Welcome, we desire full transparency in regards to the recent developments into our accounting practices.

This company is a sham.  It’s all a sham.  We literally are billions of dollars in debt, we lose $4,000 on every car.  We have never been and never will be profitable.  We have cooked the books for the last 2 years.  

You were all scammed and taken advantage of, this whole company is a ponzi scheme.  Please, do not invest in us anymore, we are officially one quarter away from bankruptcy with no plans to change course.

1hr0s67,m4uyhjc,"Taxes?

I have a bot running 24/7 buying and selling for a 0 target profit just to waste IRS manpower and money when I do my taxes.

I print and send the IRS all the documentation about my trades in paper form to stop them from automatizing the process with a computer program.

I mix blank pages, double prints, ghost prints, mark/write in them, etc just in case they have a way to scan and use some sort of recognition software to trivialize the work. That way they MUST look at thousands upon thousands of pages individually and see random schizo scribblings, swastikas, drawn dicks, etc while doing their job.

It’s a whole pallet full of shit so I hire a guy to forklift and send the entire stack because I assume it’s more troublesome for the IRS to deal with it that way.

All the documents are numbered but I pack everything “randomly” (wink wink) in case the timeline of the trades is important. I leave the first trades of the fiscal year at the bottom of the pallet AND at the bottom of each box so they now have to bend the knee to deal with boxes before they even start looking at the numbers.

My normal trades are also mixed in so they can’t just ignore everything. I pay a tax managing company to make sure everything is flawless as I assume whoever has to deal with the bullshit extra work is going to triple check everything to fuck me over as a form of revenge which unknowing increases their work load further.

This costs me thousands of dollars every year. I make sure to send the invoices of how much all the processes cost me wrapped in the pallet so that whoever is in charge of it knows I’m wasting the equivalent of three months of their waging doing asinine shit.
