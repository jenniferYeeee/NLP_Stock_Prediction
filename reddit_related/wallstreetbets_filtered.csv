post,SPY,1jz868y,"Loss Porn: SPY $515 Puts, a Masterclass in Financial Acrobatics So, I decided to spice up my Friday afternoon by purchasing 107 SPY $515 puts set to expire today. Because you know, who needs a weekend free from anxiety?

SPY responded by moonwalking to 541, turning my puts into digital fossils. Robinhood doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge their existence anymore they‚Äôre just ghost entries haunting my portfolio.

But here‚Äôs the twist‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still standing. Portfolio is over $500k, YTD gains at 45% down from 60%. This loss? A mere plot twist in my epic saga.

Moral of the story?
1) If you see a bird flying backward, it‚Äôs not a bearish omen‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just a glitch in the matrix and you‚Äôre the bug. 
2) Zero dte options are not a strategy, they‚Äôre a cry for help written in candle patterns. 
3) Never trust a chart you read after three energy drinks, tequila sodas and one emotional breakdown.

And now‚Ä¶ I will rise!

The next play? Legendary.
Not ‚Äúmade money‚Äù legendary.
More like ‚ÄúSEC read the thread out loud during a board meeting‚Äù legendary.

No research. No stop loss. Just raw, uncut vibes.
This isn‚Äôt about revenge it‚Äôs about destiny.

It‚Äôs gonna be the kind of move that either ends up on CNBC or as a warning slide in a Blackrock onboarding video.
There is no in between.


Stay tuned.
Because either I‚Äôm printing tendies‚Ä¶
or becoming a case study in ‚Äúwhat not to do with your hard earned money.‚Äù

Time to YOLO so hard, even my therapist will need therapy. 

STAY FABULOUS REGARDS.

post,TSLA,1jyfkuo,"TSLA Q2 Deliveries Not interestd in long-term debates about viability but, short-term, this has got to be peak uncertainty about the company's future. Q2 delivery consensus has come down a bit but estimates north of 350k still scream 'general TSLA challenges' not refelcting a scenario where Q2 winds up being a complete crisis quarter.

  
Why couldn't Q2 deliveries potentially seize up and wind up coming in < 200k if only for one quarter? 

Q1 typically being weak, seasonality and other historical factors are of little value at this point in time as it seems like there has been a structural shift in the perception of TSLA that isn't going back anytime soon. In fact, so much has happened in such a short period of time that any projections based on YoY trends or growth rates seem antiquated to me. Looking Q1 25 as a baseline - Q2 2025 estimates that reflect an expectation of QoQ growth in units delivered seem aggressive to say the least when broken down regionally:

2025 Q1 Deliveries: 337k:

US 128k

China 79k

EU 63k

RoW approx. 67k with biggest shares from:

Canada 8k

SK/JPN 9k

AU/NZ 6k

Mid East/LATAM combine for 21k

The current 367k Q2 consensus reflects 17% expected YoY decline in deliveries and, holding regional sales mix constant from Q1, implies Q2 expected deliveries:

US 140k

China 86k

EU 69k

RoW 73k

Q1 deliveries were announced Apr 2, the morning of the 'recprocal' rate announcements. The quarter has just begun and the escalations in uncertainty that have taken place only very recently will impact TSLA for all of Q2 most likely. 

I'm having a tought time seeing US deliveries growing by 12k in Q2 vs the first three months of this year considering how quickly the brand has deteriorated...

Above all however, I see the biggest shock risk in the EU and China for Q2 deliveries. 

On Friday we saw TSLA announce a pause on taking orders on certain models in China. That can obviously be rescinded on a whim but, at the same time, can be expanded just as easily too. I think the tit-for-tat risk with China and US tariff escalation may have peaked but headline risk is still high on a day-to-day basis and, given TSLA's proximity to the administration, any new flare ups are likely to hurt TSLA directly. In fact, I would go as far to say China might be inclined to take actions specifically targetting TSLA and Musk if for no other reason than the perceived rift it could cause between Trump and Musk. For China in Q2, can we really say there isn't at least an elevated chance that all new orders and deliveries could be paused at least temporarily? 

At the same time, I cannot fathom how EU Q2 deliveries could show an increase of 6k vs. Q1. I think very soon (gut sense says this month) we will see the EU and China announce a deal on EVs opening up the Euro Zone market for BYD and others.. EU EV market share is already falling off of a cliff with sentiment towards the US and Musk in particular continuing to decline further. I really think a comprehensive EV deal between China and the EU could mark the start of the end of TSLA in Europe. 

Canada might be relatively small overall but Q1 Canadian deliveries were 8.6k - my understanding is a significant majority of those were sold during a particular weekend in January to take advantage of a government EV credit that has since expired. A lot has changed even since January as far as US/Canada relations - does anyone really expect any TSLAs to be delivered in Canada this quarter? 

I could see this being the kitchen sink quarter that gives Musk the cover to step away from DOGE as he's needed back at TSLA FT to oversee the 'robot transition'. Afterall, it's been about a year since he told everyone robo taxis were only a year or so away so it's time to come back and pump everyone up with more fantastical promised. I am bearish on TSLA fundamentals and think event contracts on Q2 deliveries might even be a decent way to hedge shenanigan risk on a stock short.

**Prognosis:** TSLA Q2 deliveries could be *significantly* below consensus estimates (350k+).  OP outlines multiple headwinds including deteriorating brand perception, potential US/China trade war escalation, and emerging competition in the EU.  OP believes deliveries could potentially fall below 200k.

post,NVDA,1jybkss,"Could the exemption actually be bad for big tech Lutnick said today that the exemptions were done so that the exempted items could be included in the coming semiconductor tariffs (in the next month or two), and that the metric for this was so that those tariffs would not be negotiable because they are important for national security.

To me this sounds like he is saying everything not exempted (the stuff still tariffed at 145%) is negotiable, but semiconductors and pharmaceuticals won‚Äôt be negotiable when their new tariffs come.

Like the rest of the world I think Monday will be big green for AAPL, NVDA, etc.  and that the rising tide will probably lift all ships, but in the long run this actually sounds like really bad news for big tech.

Got in a load of NVDA calls (they had other good news and was up a lot on the day anyway so a good candidate) first then SPY until I was fully in, maybe 2 mins after the news tweet. Then the stocks and shares ISA just maxed NVDA shares lol.

I was almost instantly im green and it was just a matter of how long I will hold. I watched for a while and kept monitoring throughout the day, it was just relentless buying. I sold everything 20 mins from the close and I have gained a lot (it's not a 10000% gain or anything but good enough for me).

post,SPY,1jwdyo5,"Turned $20k into $40k overnight on SPY puts, then realized I could‚Äôve had $250k. I am simultaneously a genius and a certified potato. Well boys, I‚Äôm a gambler, but with an MBA in Finance and Economics, which makes me a dangerous retard. Like, I paid six figures to learn how to lose money more efficiently.

So yesterday, while drunk off six tequila sodas and 2.5 bad decisions, I had a vision from the stonk gods (or maybe it was just the hangover kicking in early). I slapped $20k on 150 SPY $525 puts that expired today. Full send. Balls deep. No lube. Just vibes.

Woke up this morning, still half-pickled from last night, saw my account was at $40k. Doubled up. Cool. But my brain‚Äîoperating at a solid 12% capacity‚Äîsaid, ‚ÄúNice tendies, let‚Äôs not be greedy.‚Äù So I sold.

Then I blacked out again metaphorically this time‚Äîl and didn‚Äôt check the markets until mid-day.

That‚Äôs right. A quarter-freaking-million dollars. From a $20k YOLO. I could‚Äôve walked into Gucci and asked for the deed. I could‚Äôve adopted a baby dolphin. I could‚Äôve bought 500,000 McChickens and still had cash for sauce.

But no.

I locked in my peasant gains and left a private island worth of tendies on the table.

Being a responsible trader is for cowards.
Risk management is a scam.
And most importantly, never trade sober.

A win is a win‚Äîbut this one stinks worse than my ex‚Äôs crypto picks.

post,"SPY,NVDA",1jwdal8,"I all-in'd and held 400k in UVIX for 6 months. I finally sold. First off, I would like to preface this with saying my condolences to those who have incurred any losses lately. It has been a very volatile week, and I know many friends and family who have suffered heavy losses in their portfolio and are stressed/anxious for the future to come. With that, I would like to share my experience betting against the American economy by holding one of the most volatile stock for 6 months, UVIX.

As many of you may know, VIX is an index that grows rapidly when the market reverses from a peak. I personally witnessed this during Covid (when TVIX rose almost 2000%) and the recent ""Yen Carry Trade"" of August 5th (when UVIX rose 400%). I've always aspired to time the market successfully with UVIX.

Last year, I felt that the economy was overextended for many reasons. You guys may not agree that these are factors to what led us here, but these are why I ended up taking the biggest risk of my life with such high confidence that the market would crash short-term.

\- US National Debt: We've reached a staggering $36 trillion debt, a large increase of 8 trillion post-covid. To me, this was a huge red flag indicating a looming recession, especially since the market was still pumping.

\- AI Bubble: I think AI is heavily over-hyped, and the rise of NVDA/Tech stocks were not really warranted. I saw this as a bubble bound to pop, much like the dot-com and housing bubble of 2008.

\- Terrible job market: I think we've been experiencing a bad labor market across all sectors for a while now. Employers look to make lay-offs/cost cutting in order to artificially inflate profit margins to boost stock prices, which is not sustainable. I do not believe the numbers released by the Feds at all, they seem suspiciously low compared to real-world experiences of people struggling to find work. This article was one example:  
[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555)

\- Suicide rate is apparently one of the leading indicator of a struggling economy: In 2024, we reached one of the highest rate in the decade [https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-09-26/u-s-suicide-rate-climbs-back-to-highest-in-decades)

\- Trump winning the presidential election: I was aware of his tariff plans during his campaign, and I knew that if he actually did implement these, it would shock the market. It was only a question of if he would actually deliver on his campaign promise or not, which he did.

With all these reasonings in mind, I had a 90% confidence that the market would crash soon, so I YOLO'd my whole portfolio into UVIX after election.

https://preview.redd.it/ovma6m9vj3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd719e0b6d0ff7892d07461aa3eae2312d52caea

Holding this ticker was mentally tough, the market kept rallying from 580 to 620 post-election, and my position was decaying and I was holding a -200k loss for the vast majority of the time. Many people discouraged my position, and some think I should cut my losses. I even isolated myself for a while because I was so sure of my bet. There were two moments when I could have sold to break even: Federal reserve announcing no future interest rate cuts and Trump's initial Canada/Mexico tariffs. But UVIX didn't rise as much as I anticipated, so I kept holding.

https://preview.redd.it/e5e6xfsxj3ue1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f45917088fa769ca5123420f1fec427851fbb2f

Fast forward to last week, Trump announced a severe blanket tariff, which crashed the market as we know it. This was finally the moment I've been waiting for as UVIX went from $20 to $100 in the span of 4 days. I kept my eyes on the news, set my alarm to 6 am to watch the market open. UVIX could rapidly drop/rise in matter of seconds, and I did not want to sell too early/late, so I was shedding 1k shares a day to be safe. 1k at 70, 1k at 90, 2k at 100 on Tuesday. At this point, I had 3k remaining, and I was hoping that UVIX would maybe rise to 140, but then Trump sent out the tweet that he's basically cancelling the tariffs, which shot the market back up, and plummeted UVIX to 40, luckily I was able to salvage and sell at 56 on the way down. It wasn't quite the finish I was hoping for, but overall, I did get to gain roughly 250k off of my 400k bet.

https://preview.redd.it/k4bzie1sk3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=f788c3fce00964a3a5e9f9202b6db85d3f5bda4a

Now that I've been able to cash out on the big -20% SPY crash I've anticipated, I am completely out of UVIX for now. Even if the market continues to fall, I have full confidence that we'll eventually recover back to our previous 620 ATH, so I'll be DCAing into SPXL/TQQQ from this point on until we reach that price.

https://preview.redd.it/8j48yvnul3ue1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=b68d62402c4fdc3ec905d7c036fcd3cee5ff37f1

In the end, I would not encourage anyone else to do what I did. Even with my conviction and accurate market reading, I had to hold UVIX for 6 months, which ended up being one of the most stressful thing I could do. I've lost sleep, became disillusioned with the economy/government, and absorbed more bad news than I could handle. I've internally cheered for bearish news, despite knowing it could mean hardship for many people.

I was somewhat lucky that Trump did indeed enact his tariffs, otherwise I may have been stuck holding a decaying position until it went to zero or was delisted.

In the end, I'm just relieved that I could finally exit my large UVIX positions, and I will never all-in again the way I did. I hoped you all enjoyed my perspective/story and I wish the best of you luck in navigating this volatile market.",5727,2025-04-11 00:36,

post,SPY,1jw4ei4,"Buried Treasuries **TL;DR**
This chart is the flowchart version of a hedge fund trying to farm nickels using 10x leverage, in a system duct-taped together by repo plumbing and the hope that volatility stays dead. If this blows up, the Fed has to come out with the ‚Äúvolatility suppressor tool‚Äù (a.k.a. buy everything that isn‚Äôt nailed down) before margin calls start going out like Amber Alerts.

Short: GS, MS, JPM, TLT
Long: VIX

**What the Hell am I looking at?**

This flowchart illustrates the U.S. Treasury basis trade, a.k.a. the 900 IQ arbitrage strat where hedge funds try to pick up pennies in front of a steamroller made of illiquidity, duration risk, and repo gremlins.

**Here‚Äôs the strategy:**
	1.	Hedge funds go long a Treasury bond (usually with borrowed money via the repo market) and short the futures contract on that bond.

	2.	The bond they long is the CTD (Cheapest to Deliver) ‚Äî think of it as the bond equivalent of buying Temu knockoffs instead of brand name, but only if the Temu knockoff is able to settle into your futures position. *Looks good enough, we‚Äôll let it slide*

	3.	They make money if the ‚Äúbasis‚Äù (cash bond price - futures price - repo cost) narrows, which it usually does unless the market experiences significant volatility.

**How they do it:**
	‚Ä¢	Repo dealers slide them the money to buy the bonds. *$20 is $20*

	‚Ä¢	Prime brokers pass the CTD bonds around like they‚Äôre at a frat party.

	‚Ä¢	CME clearing asks for margin like a little bitch.

	‚Ä¢	Futures are shorted against the long bond so it‚Äôs ‚Äúdelta-neutral,‚Äù which is finance speak for ‚Äúwe think we‚Äôre hedged but we can‚Äôt find the paperwork.‚Äù

**Why this matters:**
If and when this spontaneously unwinds (like say, in a liquidity crisis), you get forced deleveraging, margin calls, and Treasury yields go turbo ‚Äî not because inflation is surging, but because hedge funds are panic-selling like they heard *good afternoon* at a Jpow speech.

Yields skyrocket, bonds fall with equities, and the FED has to act quickly to dampen volatility.

**How to profit:**
OTM SPY puts or VIX calls
Puts on banks with highly leveraged brokerage arms (GS, MS, JPM) or ETFs that include them (XLF, KRE)

**Play for gambler‚Äôs ruin speed-runners**

Deep ITM TLT puts (synthetic short) 

Wait for tangible distress in the markets (BTC crashing HARD is a good indicator that risk is off the table for real)

But then I remembered that earlier in the day I wanted to hedge against a possible parabolic rally due to tarriff news so I had scrolled through spy options until I got high enough that the massive premiums disappeared and threw 250$ in 533 calls for a couple cents each, think it was about 57 contract in all.

Needless to say by the end of the day my port was saved and even doubled....I could've gotten like triple the profit from these calls but I started slowly selling them after the initial parabolic rally because I was afraid of a pop back down.

‚ÄúI believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. We‚Äôre a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.‚Äù

\--Donald Trump, 1988



[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.

This has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of ""loopholes"" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.

Their goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:

* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that ""deindustrialization is a national security risk"".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&sid=sitemap&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that ""every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait."" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.
* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.

So, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.

What does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that ""liberation day"" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to ""buy the dip."" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.

**\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.**

**""TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA"" --me**

**""THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP"" --me**

**""TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD"" --me**

However, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of ""reducing the trade deficit with China"" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.

tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.

**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**

I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.

Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...

Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.

Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:

**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**

**He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.**

Simply put:

AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.

However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week.

post,NVIDIA,1jvcs8u,"Trump administration backs off Nvidia's H20 chip crackdown after Mar-a-Lago dinner, NPR Reports [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-administration-backs-off-nvidias-170237325.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-administration-backs-off-nvidias-170237325.html)

The Trump administration has reversed course on plans to restrict exports of Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence chips to China after CEO Jensen Huang attended a Mar-a-Lago dinner last week, NPR reported on Wednesday.

The reversal comes despite months of work on new export controls and mounting national security concerns from both sides of the aisle. Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chip is currently the most advanced AI hardware legally allowed for export to China, and Chinese firms like ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent have reportedly placed around $16 billion in orders just in Q1.

Sources suggest the about-face was tied to Nvidia‚Äôs promise of new AI investments in U.S. data centers - effectively trading access to Chinese markets for domestic tech growth. The White House and Nvidia have both declined to comment.",273,2025-04-09 18:19,

post,S&P 500,1jv9csy,"Trading Day: All pain, no gain on Wall Street Well, folks, what started as a hopeful relief rally in Asia and Europe turned into a total dumpster fire for U.S. markets today. Wall Street was riding high with stocks up nearly 5% early on, but then Trump doubled down on his promise of insane 104% tariffs on Chinese imports, and it all went to hell. The S&P 500 dropped 1.6%, closing below 5000 for the first time in a year, while the Nasdaq took a 2%+ beating and is now down 25% from its December peak. Meanwhile, long-dated U.S. bond yields spiked hard‚Äî30-year yields are up 36 bps in just two days, one of the wildest jumps ever. Investors are freaking out, and it‚Äôs not hard to see why: this trade war escalation with China is looking uglier by the minute.

Overseas, it‚Äôs a mixed bag. Japan‚Äôs Nikkei had a banger day, up 6%, and European stocks popped 3.5%, their best in over three years‚Äîguess they‚Äôre still riding the ‚Äúmaybe we dodge the worst of this‚Äù wave. But China‚Äôs yuan? Oof, it‚Äôs getting crushed, hitting an all-time low past 7.40 per dollar offshore, and people are betting Beijing might weaponize its currency in this mess. Safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc are up over 1% against the dollar, while oil‚Äôs down 2%‚ÄîBrent crude‚Äôs lost 30% in a year. Oh, and Trump‚Äôs team is out here trying to sweet-talk Japan and South Korea into tariff deals, but the China standoff is the real market-killer. Optimism? Dead. Futures are pointing to a 2% drop at tomorrow‚Äôs open. Buckle up.

The kicker? Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump want those 10-year yields down to ease borrowing costs and the government‚Äôs monster debt burden, but the market‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúNah, fam.‚Äù Yields are climbing despite the chaos‚Äî10-year‚Äôs above 4.10-4.20% again‚Äîbecause tariffs might juice inflation, and the Fed‚Äôs not rushing to cut rates (Powell‚Äôs sounding hawkish AF). Foreign investors aren‚Äôt piling into Treasuries like they used to either, maybe because faith in U.S. assets is shaky with all this tariff drama and political noise. China could even start dumping bonds as a trade war flex. Bottom line: markets are a mess, yields won‚Äôt behave, and this global trade showdown‚Äôs got everyone on edge. Thoughts?

post,"TESLA,TSLA",1jv0l7a,"It looks like somebody saved Musk from a margin call in 2022 Let's reiew some details around Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter. On April 14th, 2020, Musk announced he wanted to buy Twitter. Initially, Twitter resisted the proposal. Six days after the initial announcement (April 20th), Musk announced he'd secured funding for the deal, funding which, according to a [commitment letter from Morgan Stanley](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922049844/tm2213189d8_ex99-i.htm), included a $12.5 billion margin loan against Musk's TSLA stock. Then, on April 25th, Twitter dropped its opposition to the proposal and accepted Musk's offer.

But the $12.5 billion margin loan never happened. And I find the timeline of how it didn't happen very interesting. On May 4th, Musk announced [revised financing terms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922056055/tm2214608-1_sc13da.htm) which cut the margin loan to $6.25 billion. Then on May 13th Musk announced was the deal ""on hold"", before two hours later saying he was ""Still committed to acquisition"". But this left people wondering what the hell Musk was doing. Then on May 24th Musk announced [new financing terms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922064655/tm2216931d1_sc13da.htm) with no margin loan. At the time, financial columnist Matt Levine [interpreted this as proof](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-26/elon-called-off-his-margin-loan) that Musk was just kidding about the deal being ""on hold"". After all, it's not like putting a deal that's already been signed ""on hold"" is a thing in the M&A world anyway.

Except then in July, Musk's lawyers sent Twitter a letter, [made public in an SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922078413/tm2220599d1_ex99-p.htm), saying they really were terminating the deal based on alleged breach of contract on Twitter's part. Twitter sued, and Musk looked ready to fight, before finally going ahead with the acquisition in October.

It's a good thing (for Musk, anyway) that the margin loan never happened. According to the commitment letter, the $12.5 billion loan would've been against $62.5 billion in TSLA stock, and would be subject to a margin call if the loan value ever exceeded 35% of the value of the collateral. Furthermore, on January 3rd of the following year, TSLA closed below $325/share, and almost fell below $305/share three days later before recovering. (TSLA has since undergone a 3:1 stock split, so if you're comparing to the current price, think of this as almost hitting $100/share.) Under the original financing plan for the Twitter deal, this almost certainly would have result in a margin call, since in the entire month of October, when the deal closed, the stock had never fallen below $600/share (or $200/share in split-adjusted terms).

Then, in a coda almost nobody noticed, Tesla released the [proxy statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312523094075/d451342ddef14a.htm) for its 2023 shareholder meeting, which included a section on ""Board Responsiveness"", which stated, ""We have received, and continue to periodically receive, helpful input regarding a number of stockholder-related matters... As a result, we have adopted a number of significant changes, including but not limited to... Amending our pledging policy to... cap the aggregate loan or investment amount that can be collateralized by the pledged stock of our CEO to the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock"". No such policy was mentioned in the [2022 proxy statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459022022992/tsla-pre14a_20220804.htm), obviously‚Äîit would've made the original proposal to acquire Twitter with a $12.5 billion margin loan impossible.

Taken together, all of this makes me think that *somebody* freaked out when Musk announced his original plan to finance the Twitter acquisition, and basically told him, ""what the fuck? No, you can't do that"". When billionaires get margin called, it can absolutely tank the stock price, which is probably why the commitment letter set such a relatively low threshold (35%) for triggering a margin call.

I think what happened in May 2022 is Musk initially tried to placate whoever was telling him ""fuck no"" by cutting the size of the loan in half, and when they weren't placated he tried to back out fo the deal, because he made the offer when he thought he could do the deal entirely with borrowed money and got cold feet when faced with the prospect of actually having to sell, rather than just borrow against, his TSLA stock to get the deal done. But in telling Musk ""fuck no"", whoever it was **saved Musk from himself and a margin call**.

It doesn't really matter who the ""somebody"" was, though I can't help but wonder if it was Tesla's largest shareholder‚ÄîVanguard. While known mainly for pioneering index funds, not noisy activist investing, and while I have never heard of them *starting* a proxy fight, Vanguard 100% *will* side with activist investors in proxy fights if they feel it's warranted. And they much more frequently ""engage"" with companies, and when your largest shareholder engages with you, you take it seriously, even when the engagement is phrased as polite suggestions. So I wonder if all the will-he-or-won't-he drama about acquiring Twitter in 2022 was because Vanguard wasn't happy with Musk's original plan.

Anyway, none of this means a Musk margin call is *impossible*, but I suspect it could only happen if Tesla was publicly known to be at risk of bankruptcy. I company is in serious trouble, but if you're betting against it (as I am), don't suddenly start getting careless if, say, the stock price drops to $120/share and there's a rumor going around further drops are a sure bet because Musk is getting margin called.

My positions (diagonal put spread with three contracts in each leg, plus an extra contract with longer expiry):

I know many of you trade 0DTE spy contracts and hold them as late as you possibly can. I use to do this too, but my pesky broker would always sell me out before EOD because of assignment risk. If this is something that pisses you off, I may have a solution for you.

SPX contracts.

SPX follows S&P500

But more importantly, SPX contracts are **CASH SETTLED**.

Which means, the contracts themselves will just pay you the difference in price at expiration, No need to sell.

Which also means your pesky broker has no need to sell you out end of day, because you do not have any assignment risk nor will you have to buy/sell shares at exercise time.

Did I also mention these contracts are **TAX-ADAVNTAGED**.

Any profits from these contracts are taxed at **60% long-term/ 40% short-term**.

You can hold these bad boys all the way to close on expiration day for massive swings of dopamine or depression.

if interested, ask your fellow regards if SPX contracts are right for you.

# Key Takeaways

* Shares of Rigetti Computing and IonQ gained Monday after the companies were among those selected to participate in a Department of Defense program.
* Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which also made the list, saw its shares rise.
* Shares of some quantum computing companies not selected and other artificial intelligence stocks made gains as well.

Shares of Rigetti Computing (RGTI) and IonQ (IONQ) led a quantum computing stock rally Monday in the wake of a new government initiative and as¬†[artificial intelligence stocks rebounded](https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-supermicro-surge-as-chip-and-ai-stocks-rebound-from-tariff-rout-11710658)¬†from their recent tariff-fueled selloff.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which operates under the Department of Defense, late last week announced 15 companies for a program it said will explore whether it‚Äôs possible to build a ‚Äúuseful‚Äù quantum computer that ""can achieve utility-scale operation‚Äîmeaning its computational value exceeds its cost"" by 2033.

Rigetti shares jumped about 11%, while IonQ added 10% Monday after being named for the program. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which also made the list, saw its shares rise 4%.

Some quantum companies not selected got a boost, too, as¬†[D-Wave Quantum](https://www.investopedia.com/quantum-computing-stocks-soar-wednesday-as-d-wave-claims-breakthrough-11695768)¬†(QBTS) shares gained close to 5% and Quantum Computing (QUBT) added 4%. Nvidia (NVDA), which Rigetti has partnered with, also saw its stock climb.

The gains came even as worries about new tariffs continued to weigh on broader markets, with the Dow and S&P 500 posting losses. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, however, finished Monday's session with a slight gain of 0.1%.

post,"SPY,TSLA",1jthv06,"watching for snapback setups off gap down open with historical reference and setup potential if open is lower than what we are all expecting, would focus on watching for short term reversal setups in a few oversold names. not necessarily entering into anything early but waiting for key levels to come into and watch for signs of exhaustion based on historical context in previous flushes discussed under, extreme pressure tends to revert when it gets stretched too far intraday.

so as for the historical context framework, after the 1987 crash the dow recovered about 57 percent in the two sessions that followed the bottom. same thing happened after the 2008 october flush and again in march 2020. 

the context shifts but the structure tends to repeat. liquidity dries up, forced selling takes over, and once that flow slows down you often get sharp intraday reversals even in weak broader trends. 
in 87 the crash accelerated because of dynamic hedging strategies that sold more as prices dropped, creating a feedback loop that hit futures first and then cash markets. books got overwhelmed, bids vanished, and once that flow exhausted the bounce came fast. 

in 08 it was margin pressure and credit risk. banks had to unwind whatever was liquid and those with tighter funding positions, pretty much made the selling spiral worse until coordinated policy stepped in. 
same thing again in 2020 where no one knew what earnings or demand would look like so everything risk got dumped. volatility went to the moon and alot sectors started moving in sync, and depth disappeared until liquidity support came in and flipped the tape. 

now the potential ‚Äòblack monday‚Äô we face shouldn‚Äôt be a repeat of 87 imo, but some of the same stress points are showing up. risk is extended, volatility is climbing, liquidity‚Äôs thinning out, and this recent price action looks like the front end of a liquidation cycle. if we gap down hard and that volume keeps pushing into weak books, the key is watching when that forced flow dries up. that‚Äôs usually when things snap back fast intraday and structure starts to reset. nothing guaranteed but it‚Äôs a pattern that‚Äôs repeated across every major dislocation. 

recent positions similar to this framework include tsla calls on pre march 20th setups in hood, reddit and more. all of them opened heavy and reversed clean once selling pressure faded. setups were mostly based on volume spikes near prior levels and reclaiming vwap after early weakness. this kind of move matches intraday reversal probability especially when it comes from liquidity holes followed by clear buying into strength

(Bloomberg) ‚Äî One of Wall Street‚Äôs most bullish Tesla Inc. analysts slashed his price target for the stock by 43%, citing a brand crisis created by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump‚Äôs trade policies.

‚ÄúTesla has essentially become a political symbol globally,‚Äù Daniel Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst who‚Äôs rated the carmaker‚Äôs shares a buy for the last four years, wrote in a report to clients Sunday. ‚ÄúIt is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty.‚Äù

Ives reduced his Tesla share-price target to $315 from $550, which had been the second-highest among the 72 analysts tracked by Bloomberg.

Ives‚Äô biggest concern is the potential for Tesla to get caught up in backlash against the US president‚Äôs tariff policies in China, where Tesla generated more than a fifth of its revenue last year. President Xi Jinping‚Äôs government plans to impose a 34% tariff on all imports from the US starting April 10, matching the level of Trump‚Äôs so-called reciprocal tariffs on Chinese products.

‚ÄúThis will further drive Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD, Nio, Xpeng and others,‚Äù Ives said in his note issued Sunday. ‚ÄúWe now estimate Tesla has lost/destroyed at least 10% of its future customer base globally based on self-created brand issues, and this could be a conservative estimate.‚Äù

Tesla shares plunged 15% in the two days after Trump announced he would apply at least a 10% tariff on all countries‚Äô imports into the US, with even higher duties on some 60 nations to counter trade imbalances. The stock has fallen 50% from its record high reached Dec. 17.",2993,2025-04-06 19:11,

post,SPY,1jt13rd,"Does the value of deep OTM 0DTE SPY puts make sense given level 3 circuit breaker limits? We know Level 3 circuit breakers prevent the market from closing more than 20% down in a single day. For a 0DTE option, this seems to create a situation where it's impossible for these deep OTM puts to finish in the money.

Logically, if an option has zero chance of being exercised profitably, shouldn't its value be zero? Yet these contracts for Monday are trading for way over $0.01.

My understanding is that factors like IV and gamma ultimately derive their significance from the potential payoff at exercise. If that potential payoff is definitively capped at zero by market rules for that day, why do these other factors still seem to support a non-zero price? Or am I missing something?",146,2025-04-06 18:38,

comment_under_post,SPY,mlrxnu6,"Here is the math for April 8 405 OTM naked puts.
Also funny enough there is volume and activity for it. 
1. Maximum Profit:

If SPY stays above the $405 strike and the option expires worthless, your maximum profit would be the premium you received for selling the put option.
Maximum Profit= 83 USD

2. Maximum Loss:

If SPY falls to zero, you would be required to buy the shares at the $405 strike price. The maximum loss is the difference between the strike price and the premium received.
Maximum Loss= 40,417 USD

3. Collateral (Margin Requirement):

This is the amount you need to set aside in margin to sell one contract. For a $405 strike price, the collateral would be:

Data from¬†[the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm)¬†released Friday showed 228,000 new jobs were created in March, more than the 140,000 expected by economists, and above than the 117,000 seen in February. The unemployment rate rose to 4.2% from the 4.1% seen in the prior month. February's monthly job gains were revised lower from a previous reading of 151,000.

Wage growth, an important measure for gauging inflation pressures, rose 3.8% over the prior year in March, down from the 4% seen in February. On a monthly basis, wages increased 0.3%, up from the 0.2% seen the prior month.

I wish you the best of luck, but I just exited my short positions, because Musk announcing he will come back to the company will have the price increase by an easy 20%. 
I am detain that over this year, with the USA going into a proper recession, Tesla will drop again like a stone. Hence, I am DCAing (but in puts ;)).",1,2025-04-04 07:59,1jr2t0i

comment_under_post,TSLA,mld5i1f,"Congrats buddy, premarket looks great :).  

Wish I‚Äôd had more settled cash yesterday, I only put $1000 into 5 $230 puts.

I‚Äôm guessing we see a pump today, though, and it might even end up positive by the end of the day.  Maybe.  Personally I‚Äôm going to be watching the moment the market opens and trying to judge the bottom and then switching briefly to calls again, then trying to identify the top, and then buying and holding a modest amount of puts overnight.  My bet is similar to yesterday: We quickly hit the floor for the day and then it slowly rises through the day.  About 2-4 hours before close, it will start to slowly fall off again.

Again all my hunches. 

I would be very very careful about holding your puts past this point.  I do not anticipate that we will break $200 until at least a week or two, and I think there are plenty of wildcards to make this stock get quickly pumped back to $290, rational thought be damned.

I think Trump is still unconvinced that the market will go down all that much, but I think he has a breaking point, and at that point blatant fuckery will occur, with TSLA in particular.",1,2025-04-04 12:41,1jr2t0i

post,SPY,1jqv7m3,"üåàüêª LFG part 2 - Liberation Day + XSP vs SPY explanation Ok so first... yes, fuck me for the beautiful bulbous gains. This is just what I was holding towards the end of the day and I actually pared down a few more on that last drop at the end of the day. In total I'm up about $50k with about $35k realized now. Total cost basis was about $15k. Probably my best trade ever so please don't look to me for trade advice. I'm just as regarded as the next guy in this sub.

**SPY vs XSP**: The reason I trade XSP options vs SPY options is because of an obscure tax rule known as Section 1256 (I'm a CPA fyi). SPY is an ETF as I'm sure every regard knows, but XSP is an index. Without getting too technical, basically gains from index options are treated as 60% long term / 40% short term. Gains from regular options on stocks/ETFs/etc are going to be 100% short term (unless you held the option for over a year, which i'm assuming most regards are not). If you're really regarded you may not realize, but long term gains are subject to lower taxes. 

**TLDR**: XSP options taxed more favorably than SPY options

Originally, when I found about the tax rule I only knew about SPX (S&P500) and NDX (Nasdaq). You can trade these for the same section 1256 tax treatment, however the notional amounts for these contracts are much larger. One atm SPX contract is about $12k and for NDX it's something like $50k. $XSP and $XND are mini/micro versions so equivalent option contracts are only a fraction. This allows me buy contracts in bunches to DCA my cost basis or leave runners when I have gains. Note that I actually started with XND options in late Feb. They work just as well, but much lower volume than XSP, which is why I primarily started trading XSP options.

I don't heavily trade options like this on a regular basis. Last time I did was during Covid volatility and subsequent run up. This correction from all time highs just seemed pretty obvious (imo) especially when the new admin started threatening reciprocal tariffs. It was a speculative gamble that paid off. I could've just as easily been fucked right now if the tariff announcements were better than expected. The reason I was pretty confident in the overall direction of the market was when I read that most institutional money/professional money managers have been steadily decreasing their market exposure to US equities in response to the planned tariffs.

What's next? No fucking clue. Obviously depends a lot on whether tariffs are scaled back and favorable trade deals are negotiated. I still have some long exposure to stocks and ETFs that I'll be looking to DCA my cost basis. Fixed income looks chill in my opinion. I may sell some puts on stocks I'd like to own at discounted prices. I'll also probably buy a few more lotto puts in case shit really starts to the hit the fan. Just to reiterate for good measure: I am just as regarded as the next guy in this sub and none of this should be taken as financial advice",44,2025-04-03 21:44,

So apparently we priced in Armageddon but not Super Armageddon. I was floored when I saw what was unveiled on Liberation Day. Yall can clown on me for being wrong in my DD when I said no one cares about tariffs. HOWEVER, this does not change my opinion on Robinhood. I figured it was a good idea to estimate what the option bids were going to be on open so I could sell at a small loss and open a position on Monday when the options prices lowered to dirt cheap. I was tired of getting manhandled by theta on my calls, so I went all in on one massive call that got hammered in price recently.

Main events I am watching is JPOW tomorrow because I have some FDs for Friday not big enough to post, Earnings smash on 4/30, possible S&P 500 inclusion in early June, crypto event this summer, more prediction markets for major leagues possible.

Buying options at dirt cheap and continuing my contrarian idea because everyone thinks the bear market is guaranteed this year, so logically they all aren‚Äôt allowed to be right.

Historical Bear Market Percentages: 

 * Average Decline: The average bear market sees a decline of around 35%. However, this can range from just over 20% to nearly 90%.
 * Smallest Decline: Some bear markets have had relatively small percentage declines, such as the one in July 1990 which saw a drop of approximately 19.9%.
 * Largest Decline: The most severe bear market on record was during the Great Depression, where the S&P 500 plummeted by approximately 83% between 1929 and 1932. Other significant declines include the bear markets of 1973-1974 (-48.2%) and 2007-2009 (-56.8%).
Historical Bear Market Durations:
 * Average Duration: The average bear market lasts about 15 months. However, durations have ranged from a few weeks to several years.
 * Shortest Bear Market: The shortest bear market occurred in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lasting only 33 days.
 * Longest Bear Market: The longest bear market coincided with the Great Depression, spanning from 1929 to 1932, a period of almost 3 years. Other lengthy bear markets include the one from 2000-2002 (31 months) and 1973-1974 (21 months).

It's literally just how much can MM's and hedgies make off moving it from options/getting overleveraged retards margin called.

The price of the ticker is irrelevant. It could be $50 or $5000 for companies like Nvidia or Tesla. Market cap is an imaginary concept for these types of companies that are main stream popular and traded on high volume. Especially since Nvidia is in every fucking index ever including the Dow.

Nothing indicates Nvidia's pace is slowing down. In fact more chips, as well as orders from NEW customers, have been ordered since DeepSeek was released than before, yet clown propaganda would suggest the sky has fallen. It's what happens when the unintelligent retards have the money and the market no longer has regulation.

post,TESLA,1jps2rr,"Rivian posts sharp fall in quarterly deliveries as soft demand weighs (Reuters) - Rivian reported a 36% decline in first-quarter deliveries on Wednesday, as the electric-vehicle maker grapples with weak demand, sending its shares down nearly 6%.

EV makers have been battling tough demand as consumers opt for cheaper hybrid and gas-powered vehicles in an uncertain economic and political environment.

""I would say the sector at the moment is out of favor. Over the medium to long term, EVs are still inevitable, and so it's just going to take some time for these companies to continue to ramp up,"" said Andres Sheppard, senior equity analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.

Rivian Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough had said in February vehicle deliveries would be lower this year due to soft demand, partially because of the impact of fires in Los Angeles.

Demand could be further pressured as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are expected to accelerate inflation and increase prices of automobiles, making consumers wary of committing to big purchases.

Sheppard said Rivian's margins would be affected by tariffs, and it could face a larger hit from the duties as opposed to bigger players such as Tesla.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe had said earlier this year the company expects higher costs from tariffs on Mexico and Canada as it has a supply chain footprint in these countries.

The company delivered 8,640 vehicles in the quarter ended March 31, down from 13,588 a year earlier. But the deliveries exceeded analysts' estimate of 8,200, according to Visible Alpha.

Tesla reported a 13% slump in quarterly sales, its weakest performance in nearly three years, as backlash to CEO Elon Musk's embrace of far-right politics grows and consumers seek out newer models from rival EV makers.

Rivian produced 14,611 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 13,980 a year ago. It reaffirmed its annual deliveries forecast.",238,2025-04-02 15:55,

post,NVIDIA,1jppc69,"Nvidia-backed CoreWeave is the biggest U.S. tech IPO since 2021 We've got a fresh IPO that just hit Nasdaq last Friday and options already trade on this! CoreWeave / $CRWV is a Nvidia-backed cloud AI services provider. $CRWV is one of the first pure-play AI IPOs, offering AI technology in the cloud. It's backers: Nvidia, Fidelity, and Magnetar. Nvidia even anchored the IPO with a $250 million order. 

Financials: CoreWeave raised $1.5 billion in its IPO, the most for a U.S. tech offering since 2021. Revenue last year was $1.92 billion, up 737% from the year before. Growth is undeniable, but there's also a net loss of $863 million reported last year. (D'uh).

Strong Customer Base: Microsoft, Meta, IBM, and Cohere are all customers. Microsoft alone accounts for 62% of CoreWeave's revenue.

The IPO priced below the expected range, opening at $39 and closing at $40. Friday was a shitty day (-3% nasdaq) to IPO.

So, what's the play?

This isn't a short-term YOLO imho, IV is so high it's only good for writing puts. Shares for me, but you do you. Also do your own DD, obviously. Current market price is still kinda close to IPO range.

Positions: 500 shares @ about $54. IV is 170% for April, so good luck if you buy options on this, you'll need it.

post,"SPY,NVDA",1jpj2kz,"NVDA and ""Liberation Day"" NVDA and Tariff Day

This thesis serves not only as analysis of NVDA and the semiconductor sector, but is a prediction for tomorrow - ""liberation day"".  

NVDA has a wide moat due to its CUDA software, and essentially holds a monopoly on parallel processing. Not only is this a focus of massive Mag 7 AI CAPEX, but it has an ever increasing amount of use cases due to developments in autonomous driving, IOT, robotics, healthcare, and more. While DeepSeek and tariff concerns have driven shares down recently, the company has an exceptional balance sheet and a 0.92 estimated EPS for its upcoming call.  

The current administration has clearly outlined its intention to be competitive in artificial intelligence, announcing in January Project Stargate, which aims to build out massive amounts of data centers in the United States with investment in AI deemed a strategic imperative.  

A close partner of NVDA, TSMC is the clear leader in semiconductor foundries due to its cutting edge nodes, which are protected by high barrier to entry and clear lack of viable domestic competition. Just yesterday, Commerce Secretary Lutnick stated to Bloomberg that TSMC's recent commitment to investing over $100 billion in the United States exemplified the actions this administration is seeking before distributing CHIPS Act grants. This investment was announced during TSMC CEO Wei's visit to the White House, with Mandango praising him as one of the most respected people in business, claiming a policy victory as Wei's actions reflected an intention to avoid tariffs through negotiation.  

Mandango is using tariffs as a form of economic brinkmanship, in an attempt to force companies to the negotiation table where they will capitulate and strike deals favorable to the United States. But with global supply chains being necessary for the semiconductor industry to function, the administration's stated goals of AI competitiveness, and the need for computation seeming insatiable, Mandango will carve out space in policy that is favorable for the sector. While the market as a whole may still see volatility in response to these policy changes, NVDA and the like will be an exception.  

TL;DR - Supporting domestic semiconductor design is critically important to the current administration's stated goals and sentiment around negative tariff impact is overblown.  

Positions: 100 strike NVDA LEAPS (6/2026), bearish SPY iron condor (520 - 580, 20 wide, 5/16/25)",19,2025-04-02 07:39,
comment_under_post,"SPY,NVDA",mkzneqn,"# **TLDR**

---

**Ticker:** NVDA

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:** Bullish on NVDA due to  US government support for domestic semiconductor industry and AI development.  Tariffs are seen as a negotiating tactic, not a long-term barrier.

**Author's Position:** Long NVDA LEAPS (100 strike, 6/2026) and Bearish SPY Iron Condor (520-580, 20 wide, 5/16/25).  Note that the SPY position is currently significantly underwater.

**Bonus:**  Tomorrow is ""Liberation Day"" for NVDA (according to the OP).

**Bonus 2:**  Author's positions show significant losses currently on SPY, but a large profit on the NVDA LEAPS.  Proceed with caution; this is a high-risk strategy.",1,2025-04-02 07:39,1jpj2kz

post,"SPY,NVIDIA,NVDA,S&P 500,TSLA",1jpcpua,"Robinhood is the best stock on the market with the most upside potential. Link to my YOLO: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jn39s8/if\_hood\_goes\_to\_100\_by\_the\_end\_of\_june\_ill\_donate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jn39s8/if_hood_goes_to_100_by_the_end_of_june_ill_donate/)

I didn't get to post my DD with my YOLO because I failed a ban bet. Also I forgot to put it in the post.

Last week‚Äôs gold event:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&ab\_channel=Robinhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&ab_channel=Robinhood)

TLDR: IMO Robinhood is the best stock on the market right now with a great business model and the best team and has the most upside potential, even during a market downturn.

They had 1.5 million gold subscribers at $5/month last year. Now MORE THAN DOUBLED TO 3.2 MILLION.

Robinhood has the potential to become the next trillion-dollar company. Everyone is always looking for the next stock that will have NVDA or TSLA-like growth and I have good reason to believe that Robinhood is the one. Literally a 30-bagger since they‚Äôre at $37 billion, which is NOTHING. For example, about $1 trillion flew out of Nvidia in like a month and Robinhood only needs around $55 billion more to reach $100/share. They actually have a good business model leading the great leap forward in transforming finance with a CEO that is already mainstream. Man is on CNBC last week:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&ab\_channel=CNBCTelevision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision)

They are going to smash earnings again IMO. Been taking money hand over fist. They already smashed earnings last quarter.

I‚Äôd say that inclusion into the S&P 500 is on the horizon. They just missed it last quarter but I see no reason why they can‚Äôt be in this quarter with a lot of stocks tanking. And we all know what happened when TSLA was put into the S&P 500 with a similarly well-known CEO known as the Elongated Muskrat. ROCKET EMOJI.

Robinhood is overhauling everything with their services, including the use of AI. That‚Äôs right. The AI buzzword. They cap their fees at $250/year for investment advisor systems.

Cash delivery? Bruh I‚Äôm never going to an ATM again:¬†[https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

They have 12 partner banks so FDIC insurance is $2.5 million with them instead of $250,000:¬†[https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/)

Robinhood is now VENMO/Apple Pay. You can send money to people instantly:¬†[https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

Robinhood makes money on everything. Options, crypto, and now even straight-up gambling with prediction markets. Even in a terrible market they still make money on fees and subscriptions.

I don't really care about any litigation involving prediction markets and I don't think anyone else does either. Gambling always wins.

Cathie Wood bought like $25 million recently (Now holds 5% of ARKK‚Äôs holdings, TSLA is 11% for reference) and it was given a price target of $105 last week:¬†[https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bernstein-maintains-robinhood-outperform-rating-105-target-93CH-3951578](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bernstein-maintains-robinhood-outperform-rating-105-target-93CH-3951578)

IRA contribution and 401k transfer match is literally a money magnet.

People will live their entire financial lives through Robinhood. They have high-yield interest rates on uninvested cash and have a debit card. Kind of like how people use WeChat for everything.

They also have a credit card with 3% cash back on EVERYTHING (best on the market from what I‚Äôve seen) = more money.

Great Wealth Transfer putting trillions of dollars in Millennials and Gen Z hands, going straight to RH for gambling, and especially on this sub.

Robinhood is honestly like a 7x leveraged SPY imo. Every time SPY is up 1% Robinhood is up 7%, and vice versa with the same chart pattern. SPY really only needs to go to 570 for HOOD to go to $50 from $42. $50 by the end of the week bc we will get the clarity from the big dude tomorrow.

Easy to use platform.

I am also predicting we have a face-ripping rally on liberation day because no one gives a fuck about tariffs. This is all about selling the rumor and buying the news so we all have certainty. JPOW also speaks Friday so my boy is going to pump it up.

Probably some more stuff I missed but in this shit hole of a market this is the stock I choose. Robinhood, I CHOOSE YOU!",0,2025-04-02 01:30,
